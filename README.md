# OneHelp
> A basic support ticketing system for MSMEs that I built allows customers to raise tickets via email or web forms, with each ticket tracked through statuses like Open, In Progress, and Resolved.
            Support agents manage tickets through a simple dashboard with
            filters, assignment tools, and SLA-based alerts. Itâ€™s built using
            ASP.NET Core combined with Angular, secure authentication, and a SQL
            database, offering an efficient and scalable way to manage customer
            support.
